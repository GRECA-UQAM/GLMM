# LMM-GLMM
A centralised web-ressource developped by members of the GRECA (Groupe de Recherche en Écologie Comportementale et Animale) at Université du Québec à Montréal for students and new members who wish learn how to perform linear (LMM) and generalised (GLMM) linear mixed models as they are used in evolutionary behavioural ecology. 

You will find with different scripts showcasing how to properly perform, analyse, and interpret (G)LMMs analyses. These are mostly R scripts which cover basic workflows on how to conduct specific analyses and extract parameters of interest in (G)LMMs.

You may use these scripts and adapt them to your data.
