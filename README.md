# LMM-GLMM
## Autumn - 2020

This repository is a centralised web-ressource developped by members of the GRECA (Groupe de Recherche en Écologie Comportementale et Animale) at Université du Québec à Montréal for students and new members who wish to learn how to perform linear (LMM) and generalised (GLMM) linear mixed models as they are used in evolutionary behavioural ecology. 

You will find different scripts (mostly R scripts) showcasing how to properly perform, analyse, and interpret (G)LMMs.

We provide a simulated dataset to perform all analyses found in the different scripts. You may use the scripts and adapt them to your data / specific questions.
